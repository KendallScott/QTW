Every other week in class will be spent working through a case
study using Python. These case studies will be written up and turned in for a grade.
Case study write-ups are to be “technical report ready,” which basically means that it is
suitable for public viewing.
Each case study will be graded out of 100 points. The final case study will count as a
double grade and serves as a final project. See the table below for case study due
dates. Each case study has a corresponding video element in the asynchronous
material.

Case study 1 (covers
weeks 1–2). Due by
midnight CT on the day of
the live session
Welcome to the first case study. What you're about to see is a short video that simulates how a problem would be presented to a prospective data scientist. What I'd like you to do is follow along and see if you can pick up the same details or perhaps different details that our data scientist in the video is starting to ask. Grow along with this journey, so that you start to develop your skill set. And understand the details about the problem being presented, the particulars of the data being used, and the particulars of the problem.

In each video, there is a segment where we will pause. Take this opportunity to write down your own questions and notes about the case study. That is an appropriate time for you to take those notes and submit them for your participation grade. This first study is a study of linear regression. We will present more details, but use a linear regression in this case study. And follow along with our protagonist as they start to learn more about the details.

When you save your assignment, the file name should be "First Name_Last Name_Assignment Name."

Your case study is to build a linear regression model using L1 or L2 regularization (or both) the task to predict the Critical Temperature as closely as possible. In addition, include in your write-up which variable carries the most importance.
